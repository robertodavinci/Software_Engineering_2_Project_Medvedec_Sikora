\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
\hspace{\parindent}The CLup application interface will have to serve two types of users: customers and store managers. Opening screen of the application allows the user to pick a store or to login as a store manager. Depending on the choice, another screen is presented. For a customer, a screen with the options to retrieve a ticket, book a visit or change the store. For a store manager, a screen containing their camera view, and buttons to confirm the scanned ticket, notify the system about a customer exit and to log out of the application. 

The following images show some basic concepts on how the app should look on both Android and iOS devices.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\hspace{\parindent}Depending on the current user the CLup application will require access to some hardware interfaces. If the current user is a customer, the application will require the device's camera and if the current user is the store manager the GPS location data will be needed. The application will require no further hardware interfaces.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\hspace{\parindent}The CLup application will not require any specific software interfaces.
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
\hspace{\parindent}The most important communication will occur between the device and the database. The decision on the specific communication interface which will be used depends on the database, and is, therefore, left to the developers.

\subsection{Performance requirements}

\hspace{\parindent}The system is relatively simple and doesn't work with a lot of data. What the system should do properly is control the queue for every specific store. It should also sync all of the tickets that are printed out in real life, and ones that are "printed" virtually. The same queue should feature both types of tickets and work adequately. That means that when a ticket is printed, it should be inserted into queue within ten seconds, to prevent errors in the queue. It is not of a major importance if a couple of people switch places due to slow reaction time from the system, but it should be avoided if possible. 


When user want to print a ticket virtually, the system has to provide it with an average waiting time within a couple of seconds. This is a piece of data that is going to be stored in the database of every store, and it should be updated at least every 30 minutes based on the current traffic and other available data, like day of the week and time of day.


When calculating the distance from the user's current location to the desired store, the information should be available to the user in ten seconds at most. If the system is for any reason unable to calculate the distance it should display a message that it it unable to do it and continue to the next step.

\newpage

\subsection{Design constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
\hspace{\parindent}The entire application must be the subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a regulation in the EU law to protect the personal data of all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations} \label{hardware}

\hspace{\parindent}The application is only planned to be made for Android OS and iOS. Any device that doesn't use Android or iOS, but uses Windows Mobile OS is excluded from the use. Any non-smartphone mobile device will not support the application.

The application will only work on Android devices that support Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or above due to security reasons. 

The application will only work on iOS devices that support iOS 7.0 or above due to security reasons.

Device in use must have access to the internet connection during the ticket request. After it acquires the ticket, the internet connection is no longer required.
\subsubsection{Privacy limitations}

\hspace{\parindent} The application should not collect nor ask any personal information from the user. It should only request for access to publish push notifications, as well as location, but only if the user decides to use "Book a visit feature". No other data is to be collected at all. 

\newpage

\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability and availability}
\hspace{\parindent}The system must be available at all times during the day. The only times that the system is allowed to be down, due to maintenance or any other reason, is during the night hours, while the stores are not working. In that time the use of application is nearly non-existent as only the "Book a visit" function is working, and the number of users using the function should be close to zero.

In case the system has stopped working during the day, a notification has to be sent to every user that uses the application, and the queueing in stores should be taken over by the store manager until the system is back up.

\subsubsection{Security}
\hspace{\parindent}Since there is no users' personal data that is stored within the system, the security by itself is at the very high level to begin with. Logins from the store managers should be encrypted and protected. Transfer of this data to the store managers should be done safely, either by using two-way encryption or in-person.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
\hspace{\parindent}The system can be written in any language that will guarantee high level of maintainability and security at all times. It should also allow users to use the older version of the app, which means that every change made to the app must be made with legacy in mind. The code must have a clean and detailed documentation so that people who work on it have no problems upgrading the app and pushing new updates if necessary.

\subsubsection{Portability}
\hspace{\parindent}As already mentioned in the section \nameref{hardware}, the application should only work on Android and iOS mobile devices, with specific OS version limitations.

Application should not natively be supported with desktop devices since users must provide their QR code for scanning when entering the store, which would not be possible on a desktop computer, and not very usable on a laptop.
