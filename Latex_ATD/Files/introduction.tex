\hspace{\parindent} This document is a testing and acceptance document of the CLup project developed by Samuele Negrini and Giorgio Piazza.\newline

This document focuses on all three reference documents created by the group, while the main focus is on the app itself along with ITD1.0.pdf document that follows the app and explains some of its design choices.\newline

In the second chapter of the document, the process of installation of the app has been described, along with any potential difficulties regarding it (there weren't any).\newline

In the third chapter the testing done by our team has been described and some of the test results in terms of both desktop and mobile screenshots have been presented. Several issues have been found, but the apps themselves work really well and no major problems were encountered while using and testing the app.\newline

In the fourth and final chapter, we've added some additional comments as well as noted which things are not in line with the rest of the documentation and which things were supposed to be done differently. Finally, our overall experience with the whole system is also described.
