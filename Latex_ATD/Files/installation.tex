\hspace{\parindent}Installation instructions required installing the whole MySQL environment which includes MySQL Server and Workbench, Java JDK, TomEE, and Maven. The installation instructions were very detailed and easy to follow. \newline

Although this installation process is not the most elegant and it takes a while to set it all up, we were able to complete it in a reasonable amount of time. This process would usually not have to be repeated by a user of the app since the whole backend would be uploaded to the server. The creators did that as well, so we've done our testing on both our computers with their databases set up and over the servers with connection to their computers. Both cases gave the same results.\newline

The app installation for the Android device went without any issues, was pretty straightforward and worked on multiple devices that we have tested it on (Samsung Galaxy S6, Huawei P Smart, Samsung Galaxy Note 9) which all have different Android OS versions; 7, 8, and 9, respectively. \newline

The desktop (browser) version of the app worked in all tested browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Brave) and was easy to log into and use. \newline
