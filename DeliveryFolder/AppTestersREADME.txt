CLup.apk file is the real file of the app that is meant to be used.

CLupSM.apk is a version of the app where email doesn't have to be verified in order for the 
store managers to login to their accounts. We've created several "fake" store manager accounts
with fake emails so that you can check the functionality of a store manager controlling store 
customer influx. Please use this version of an app for testing. The only difference is that it doesn't
require the email to be verified and thus save us the work of creating numerous real emails for accounts.
