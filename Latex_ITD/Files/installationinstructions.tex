\hspace{\parindent} Installing and testing the app is easy.
All that needs to be done is to download .apk file from "DeliveryFolder" of our GitHub page (\url{https://github.com/robertodavinci/ Software_Engineering_2_Project_Medvedec_Sikora/tree/main/DeliveryFolder}) and install it on the phone.\newline

Make sure to allow apps from untrusted source in the settings son that the app can be properly installed since this version of the app is not signed for Google Play Store. \newline

When asked for permission to use camera, "Allow" must be pressed in order for the QR code scanner to work properly. If the camera is not allowed, the app will return to the Home screen every time a scanner is opened.\newline

There is also a possibility of importing an entire project in Android Studio and running the app on an emulator.
Simply download the whole "Implementation" folder from our repository and import the project to Android Studio. The setup should be done automatically.
