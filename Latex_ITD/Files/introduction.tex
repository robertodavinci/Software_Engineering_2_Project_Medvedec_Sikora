\subsection{Purpose}
\hspace{\parindent}This document provides a detailed view of the architecture and the implementation of the CLup system. Based on both RASD and DD documents provided in this project, that can both be found on the above provided GitHub page, this document specifies the development process and used frameworks and philosophies, as well as explains the code structure and design rationale behind the whole system.

The system implementation is done as an Android app that is available for every Android device that supports Android 8.0 and above. 

Detailed code can be found on provided GitHub page and it can also be imported as an Android Studio project in order to make adjustments to the app.

\subsection{Scope}
\hspace{\parindent}CLup is a simple application that helps store managers with handling large crowds inside their store and store customers with planning more efficient and safe grocery shops. The target audience for this application includes every person that shops for groceries in a store, so all demographics fall into this category. 

Faced with a worldwide pandemic of the COVID-19 virus countries across the world imposed strict health measures in line with the recommendations of the WHO. To combat the spread of the virus, governments introduced decrees that limited the movement of the population to a certain degree. Only essential movement, such as: going to work, grocery shopping or outdoor exercise, was deemed acceptable. Although successful in the mitigation of the disease, the act put a serious strain on society on many levels. To help reduce the stress and anxiety, many aspects of everyday life involving close contact can be considered and improved upon. 

This project aims to help with, and resolve the issues surrounding grocery shopping. As we all know, grocery shopping is an essential activity which involves close contact inside the store. Since the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly through airborne particles, this activity plays a key role in its mitigation. To reduce crowding inside the stores, supermarkets need to restrict access to their store and keep the number of people inside below the optimal maximum capacity. 

The main idea is to enable store customers to enter a queue from home (or wherever they find themselves) through simple interaction with the application.
